# Evaluation Metrics

In this section, we describe the key metrics used to evaluate our deepfake voice detection model.

## Accuracy
The proportion of correctly classified audio samples out of the total samples.

## Precision
The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.

## Recall
The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.

## F1-Score
The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics.

## Confusion Matrix
A table layout that visualizes the performance of the model, showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
