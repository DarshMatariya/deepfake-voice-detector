# Results and Analysis

After evaluating our model using the defined metrics, we observed the following:

- **Model Performance:** The model achieved an accuracy of 68.33%, a precision of 80.00%, and a recall of 51.61%. 
- **Overfitting Analysis:** The model performed significantly better on training data compared to test data, indicating potential overfitting.
- **Error Analysis:** The majority of errors were false positives, indicating the model sometimes incorrectly classifies real audio as fake.
- **Suggestions:** Implementing further data augmentation and model regularization could improve generalization.
